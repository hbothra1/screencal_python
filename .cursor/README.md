# ScreenCal Platform-Agnostic Workspace

This workspace contains platform-agnostic architecture and development rules.

## Rules

- `erules/architecture-rules.mdc` - Platform-agnostic architecture definition
- `erules/debugging-rules.mdc` - Logging and debugging guidelines
- `erules/phase-rules.mdc` - Phase-gated development process

These rules have been adapted from the macOS Swift implementation to be language and framework agnostic.
